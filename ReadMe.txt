Title: Non-Registry XP Security Functions v 1.0.0

Four functions, Six buttons and One form
show/hide desktop, show/hide taskbar, restrict/deresrict cursor to form AND disable/enable 
Ctrl+Alt+Del Without using the registry (found in a forum somewhere out in net land)
This may be a bit of a hack but for better or worse if like me you dont like messing with the registry then lump it or loathe it this is for you & respect the fact that I did not write this for any malign purposes
Bend it break it use it as you like but:- 
If you like this code please vote for it
